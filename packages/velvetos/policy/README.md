# VelvetOS policy architecture registries

Stage 0 introduces inventories and integrity checks only. These files do not replace the authorities they point to and do not change runtime authorization.

## Ownership

- `policy-registry.json` maps `policy_id` to authority locations, risk class and enforcement points. Policy decisions remain in the referenced authority until a later migration makes a machine-readable policy canonical.
- `sensor-registry.json` inventories runnable `scripts/check-*.py` sensors. Stage 0A intentionally gives legacy sensors a conservative `triggered_by=["**"]` fallback until Stage 0B/2 maps ownership and dependencies precisely.
- `artifact-retention.json` classifies storage/retention families only. `deletion_authorized=false` is mandatory in Stage 0.
- `schema/` defines the machine-readable contracts. `scripts/check-policy-architecture.py` verifies registry integrity and references.

## Policy creation freeze

On pull requests, the same check can run with `--base <sha> --head <sha>`. New normative external-effect text added to noncanonical Markdown must point to an existing registry entry using a literal line such as:

`policy_id: instagram.publish`

Canonical Constitution authorities, `office/control/POLICY.md`, and this registry documentation are exempt from that documentation freeze. The freeze does not infer policy semantics from prose; it only prevents new unregistered authorization language from appearing silently.

## Temporary safety hotfixes

A `temporary_hotfix` registry entry must identify its source authority, migration target, `review_at`, and explicit expiry behavior. `review_at` is a maintenance checkpoint, not automatic policy expiry.

## Current Stage 0 finding

`instagram.publish` is deliberately marked `conflicted` because live sources currently expose both standing tool-publish authorization and legacy/manual approval wording. Stage 0 records the conflict without resolving it. Stage 1 owns that semantic migration.
